The values that I got was over 8000 for the linked list and over 6000 for the array.
These are this high because they are being sorted using one of the slowest sorts which is bubble sort.
The linked list is slightly higher because it has to move over the nodes when it is sorting so it will need to go through
the loop a few extra times.
